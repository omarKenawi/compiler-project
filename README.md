## Introduction

MiniJava is a subset of the Java programming language designed for educational purposes. This compiler project aims to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of compiler construction, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation.

## Features

- Lexical analysis using ANTLR 3
- Parsing of MiniJava syntax
- Semantic analysis for type checking
- Intermediate code generation
- Error reporting and handling
